# iter8-analytics

## Welcome to Iter8

> **SLO validation, A/B testing and progressive delivery**

> Iter8 makes it easy to optimize business metrics and validate SLOs when you release new versions of applications and ML models on Kubernetes.

> This repo implements Iter8's analytics service. It includes the Bayesian analysis and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms used by iter8 for assessing versions and optimally shifting between them.
